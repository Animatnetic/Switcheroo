# Switcheroo

Minimalist Lag Switch

## Description
Inspired by clumsy, but I wanted an even simpler interface. Uses WinDivert for packet dropping and FTXUI for the TUI.

## Usage
1. Go To Releases
2. Download latest zip file
3. Extract zip file and store same contents in a folder (Ensure the WinDivert.sys and WinDivert.dll are in the same folder as .exe, create a Shortcut if you want to put it to desktop)
4. Run switcheroo.exe AS ADMINISTRATOR
5. Press toggle switch, and viola! If you got an error, look below

## Set of common possible errors below:
| Error Code | Message |
|---:|---|
| 2 | Either WinDivert.dll or WinDivert.sys is not in same folder |
| 5 | Acess denied (You need to run as administrator) |
